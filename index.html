                    <br>
                    <p> Currently a student of Bordeaux Science Agro, I am doing my M2 "Biodiversity and Fonctionnement of Terrestrial ecosystem" at the 
					<a href="https://www.u-bordeaux.fr/">University of Bordeaux. </a>
					<br>
					I was born at the Réunion Island, a French territory in the Indian Ocean. I had the opportunity to hike and discover the wonders this island has to offer. 
					Its unique fauna and flora with a lot of endemic species fascinated me. My need to understand more about the ecology and evolution of this ecosystem motivated me to
					study them. I am sure a better comprehension of the differents ecosystems and the evolution of the species that composed them will allow better preservation program.

					<h2>Work experiences</h2>
						
					<h3>Contractor for JEAB</h3>
						<p> Three students have been chosen to work on a bibliographic study for the INRAE.
							We work under the supervision of M Hervé Jactel at <a class="lien" href="https://www6.bordeaux-aquitaine.inrae.fr/biogeco">Biogeco</a>
							on the effect of landscape heterogeneity (beta diversity) on different factors like production, biodiversity, resistance to biotic and abiotic threats...
						</p>
						
						
					<h3>Gap year 6 month internship</h3>
			
					<p> During this internship, I studied the pollination of the chestnut at 
						<a class="lien" href="https://www6.bordeaux-aquitaine.inrae.fr/biogeco">Biogeco</a> with Mr Rémy PETIT and Mr Clément LARUE.
						I did bibliographic research on the pollination of chestnut and statistic analysis on field results that were done before I arrived.
						The objective was to determine if some factors influenced the choice of inflorescence visited by the insects.
						
						</p>
						
						
					<h3>M1 Internship</h3>
					
					<p> I did a  behavioural study of <span class="species"> Monchamus Galloprovincialis </span>, the european vector of the pine wood nematode
					<span class="species"> Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</span>.
					at <a class="lien" href="https://www6.bordeaux-aquitaine.inrae.fr/biogeco">Biogeco</a> with Mr Hervé JACTEL and Mr Jean-Baptiste RIVOAL.
					The main experiment was a mark-recapture on two sites with heterogenous landscape. The trap used pheromon attraction. 
					We couldn't finish the experiment due to the forest fire in 2022 that passed through our experiment. 
					I also had the possibility to do some bibliographic research and statistic analysis.

						<p>
						This association did not exist when I arrived at BSA, but Marine Lesieur, an other first year student, wanted to create this association and with a small group of highly motivated student, we succedeed. 
						This student association act as an intermediate between companies and the student of the school for paid project.<br>
						I was at the head of the project division at the start of the association, I oversaw the first project of the association. For each project we had to create a quotation and 
						find students for the tasks. This was an incredilbe experience, and it sure increase my competence to run project from start to finish.

					<h2>Other</h2>
					<h3> Trips </h3>
						<p>
						I have always been curious to discover other places and cultures, I think there is two reasons for that. First my parents cultivated my curiosity 
						with a lot of books and we traveled together during my childhood. Secondly the Reunion island is an incredible melting pot with people from Asia, Europe and 
						Africa. In french Réunion mean gathering, even if the name of the Island doesn't come from there, it is an ideal name for it.
						<br><br>
						I decided to learn chinese when I entered middleschool. Four years later when I was fourteen I traveled with my class to <span class="HH5">China</span> for 
						a linguistic exchange with student from Tianjin. We also had the opportunity to visit Beijing and Shanghai, 
						this was a fantastic experience and encouraged me to discover more country.
						<br><br>
						The next 2 years I was going in linguistic trips to <span class="HH5">Australia</span> and <span class="HH5">South-Africa</span> 
						with the association BEST "Bourbon Échanges Scolaires Transocéans". 
						During this trips we had english courses the morning and we visited the afternoon, we were in homestay so we could learn more about this country and its people. 
						In <span class="HH5">Australia</span> at Pearth, I really appreciatied the aborigene culture and the diversity of the fauna and the flora. 
						In <span class="HH5">South-Africa</span> we had the pleasing opportunity to learn more about the culture and historic of this country.
						<br><br>
						Furthermore I had another incredible occasion when I visited my brother in <span class="HH5">South-Korea</span> during his Phd.
						We traveled together to <span class="HH5">Japan</span>, we visited Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo. I really appreciated the japanese culture, mainly the food I have to admit it, 
						the last night of our trip in Japan we climbed the Mount Fuji
						<br><br>
						The last trip I took was in <span class="HH5">Norway</span> for my Erasmus exchange. The University is
						at Ås which is a very beautiful campus. I also had the chance to travel 
						to Tromso, the third largest city in the arctic circle, where I learned more 
						about the Sami culture. I also could fulfill one of my life goal and see aurora.
						<br><br>
						</p>
						
						<p>I did a 3 month Europe tour in van. During this this trip I visited at least one National Park by country I passed through and its capital city. 
						Here is a list of every National park I visited:
						
						<ul class="listmv">
						<li><span class="HH5">Spain</span> : Picos de Europa National Park, Caba&#241eros National Park, Do&#241ana National Park and Bardenas Reales park</li>
						<li><span class="HH5">Portugal</span> : Penada-G&ecircres National Park</li>
						<li><span class="HH5">Italy</span> : "Foreste Casentinesi, Monte Falterona, Campigna National Park" and Gargano National Park </li> 
						<li><span class="HH5">Slovenia</span> : Triglav National Park</li>
						<li><span class="HH5">Croatia</span> : Sjeverni Velebit National Park and Plitvice National Park</li>

					<h3>Interest</h3>
						<p>
						
						<span class="HH4"> Sports : </span>I was hiking a lot in Reunion island. The mountain shows some breathtaking view, I also saw the volcano of the island, "Le Piton de 
						la Fournaise" in eruption.
						
						<br>I also did 3 years of swimming in a club and I still love to swim from time to time.<br>
						Finally I did more than ten years of judo and I started french boxing at my school.		
						<br><br>
						 
						 
						<span class="HH4">Hobbies : </span>Since I'm little I really enjoy reading. I mostly read fiction : <br>
						Aventure with a lot of Jules Vernes, fantastic with Robin Hobb, and science-fiction with Frank Herbert.<br><br>
						
						I learned to play <a class="lien" href="https://www.chess.com/member/therenard">chess</a> with my father and I never stopped. 
						In highschool and at Bordeaux Sciences Agro, I founded chess clubs to help people learn and progess.
