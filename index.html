                    <p> Currently a student of Bordeaux Science Agro, I am doing an internship with Clément Larue and Rémy Petit. 
					<br>
					I was born at the Réunion Island, a French territory in the Indian Ocean. I had the opportunity to hike and discover the wonders this island has to offer. 
					Its unique fauna and flora with a lot of endemic species fascinated me. My need to understand more about the ecology and evolution of this ecosystem motivated me to
					study them. I am sure a better comprehension of the differents ecosystems and the evolution of the species that composed them will allow better preservation program.

					<h3> Trips </h3>
						<p>
						I have always been curious to discover other places and cultures, I think there is two reasons for that. First my parents cultivated my curiosity 
						with a lot of books and we traveled together during my childhood. Secondly the Reunion island is an incredible melting pot with people from Asia, Europe and 
						Africa. In french Réunion mean gathering, even if the name of the Island doesn't come from there, it is an ideal name for it.
						<br><br>
						I decided to learn chinese when I entered middleschool. Four years later when I was fourteen I traveled with my class to <span class="HH5">China</span> for 
						a linguistic exchange with student from Tianjin. We also had the opportunity to visit Beijing and Shanghai, 
						this was a fantastic experience and encouraged me to discover more country.
						<br><br>
						The next 2 years I was going in linguistic trips to <span class="HH5">Australia</span> and <span class="HH5">South-Africa</span> 
						with the association BEST "Bourbon Échanges Scolaires Transocéans". 
						During this trips we had english courses the morning and we visited the afternoon, we were in homestay so we could learn more about this country and its people. 
						In <span class="HH5">Australia</span> at Pearth, I really appreciatied the aborigene culture and the diversity of the fauna and the flora. 
						In <span class="HH5">South-Africa</span> we had the pleasing opportunity to learn more about the culture and historic of this country.
						<br><br>
						Furthermore I had another incredible occasion when I visited my brother in <span class="HH5">South-Korea</span> during his Phd.
						We traveled together to <span class="HH5">Japan</span>, we visited Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo. I really appreciated the japanese culture, mainly the food I have to admit it, 
						the last night of our trip in Japan we climbed the Mount Fuji
						<br><br>
						The last trip I took was in <span class="HH5">Norway</span> for my Erasmus exchange. The University is
						at Ås which is a very beautiful campus. I also had the chance to travel 
						to Tromso, the third largest city in the arctic circle, where I learned more 
						about the Sami culture. I also could fulfill one of my life goal and see aurora.
						<br><br>
						</p>
						<p class="nexttrip">Here I will talk about my next trip which is a tour of Europe.
						I plan on visited at least one National Park for each country 
						dependent on the side of the country starting with Spain then 
						going to Greece and to Danemark with every state in between.</p>
						
						
					<h3>Interest</h3>
						<p>
						
						<span class="HH4"> Sports : </span>I was hiking a lot in Reunion island. It is a beautiful place, the mountain shows some breathtaking view.
						
						<br>I also did 3 years of swimming in a club and I still love to swim from time to time.<br>
						Finally I did more than ten years of judo. 
						<br><br>
